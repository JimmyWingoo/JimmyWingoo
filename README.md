  BLURB -->

<p align=center>
  I am typically logged on while working to idle with my puppy, so chances are I won't notice attempts at interacting most of the time. Always sitting around spawn or the docks doing absolutely nothing ^_^

  INTERESTS -->

<p align=center> 
  <b>I very much enjoy</b> Limbus Company, Library of Ruina, Risk of Rain 1/2, Terraria, Armored Core VI, FFXVI, Stephen Sondheim (Company, The Follies, Sunday in the Park with George), Keygen Church, Hollow Knight, Ender Lillies, Warhammer 40K, Galleons, Wuthering Heights, Tenant of Wildfell Hall, Dance Gavin Dance, The Walking Dead, The Big Lebowski, Demian, Resident Evil

  <b>Feel free to</b> ask about any of the above if you want to talk about something. At the moment I'm reading through the aforementioned Tenant of Wildfell Hall, and Limbus has been an incredibly influential game ever since I've discovered it (started midway through Canto VI which is my favorite!)
